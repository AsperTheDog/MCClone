# MCClone
I try to implement Minecraft from scratch in C++

# Disclaimer
This repository is a very old archive of a project what I made to try to learn OpenGL. I used it as my first big project in C++ and in computer graphics in general. While it holds a lot of emotional value as it was my first step to what became a passion it is without a doubt code made by a total beginner.

# How to install
The project is simply a Visual Studio project with all its dependencies already included. Simply open it with Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 and run

# Features
- Dynamic meshes made from blocks that generate given a specific function
- Culling of faces that are not exposed to the air
- Dynamic chunk generation and disposal around the player
- Different configurable textures for blocks
- Basic camera and character movement
- Basic collision with the floor
- Basic lighting
